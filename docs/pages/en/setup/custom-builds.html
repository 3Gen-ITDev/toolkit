# Custom Builds #

Customizing a Toolkit build allows for specific components to be included in the output file, while ignoring the rest.
This is especially useful for projects where certain components are not needed.

To customize a build, Grunt must be installed.

To specify a list of components, pass a comma separated list of component names to the grunt command line.

```bash
grunt --components=tooltip,modal,buttonGroup
```

The custom build file will be compiled and written to the `build` folder. It's as simple as that.

A list of available components can be found in the `scss/toolkit/components` folder within the repository.

### Effects ###

Effects can be included in the build process by supplying the `effects` option in the command line.

### Themes ###

By default no theme is generated. This allows the use of default component functionality with no aesthetics applied.

To specify a theme, use the `theme` option in the command line.

```bash
grunt --theme=titon
```

A list of available themes can be found in the `scss/toolkit/themes` folder within the repository.
