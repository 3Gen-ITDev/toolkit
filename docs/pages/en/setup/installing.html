# Installing #

To get started with Toolkit, there are three different integration options.
The first being a direct download allowing for the inclusion of the files in a project.
The second through the Bower package manager.
And lastly, using Sass and Compass to extend and modify the Toolkit source files directly within a project.

### Download ###

The latest stable version can be downloaded from the official [Toolkit GitHub](https://github.com/titon/toolkit/releases).

Production ready CSS and JavaScript can be found in the `dist` folder.

### Bower Integration ###

To download as a [Bower](http://bower.io/) package, add `titon` as a dependency within your `bower.json`.

```javascript
{
    "dependencies": {
        "titon": "*"
    }
}
```

Run `bower install` to download the package. Once downloaded, include the assets in your project.

```html
<link href="/bower_components/titon/dist/toolkit.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="/bower_components/titon/dist/toolkit-jquery.min.js"></script>
```

It's also possible to include Toolkit components on a case by case basis instead of including the full component list.

```html
<script src="/bower_components/titon/dist/jquery/toolkit.min.js"></script>
<script src="/bower_components/titon/dist/jquery/toolkit-accordion.min.js"></script>
```

When using this approach, the `toolkit.min.js` file is required by all components.

### Sass Integration ###

If you prefer to use the Toolkit `scss` files directly in your project, this can easily be done through Compass.
Begin by installing the Sass and Compass gems. This requires Ruby and Ruby Gems to be installed.

```bash
gem install sass
gem install compass
```

Install the Toolkit gem.

```bash
gem install titon-toolkit
```

Require Toolkit at the top of the Compass `config.rb` file.

```ruby
require 'titon-toolkit'
```

Once the gems are installed and Compass is configured, the Toolkit `scss` files can be imported.
The available paths for import must be relative to the Toolkit [scss directory](https://github.com/titon/toolkit/tree/master/scss).
For example:

```sass
// Import all variables, mixins and functions
@import "toolkit/common";

// Import the CSS for the tooltip component
@import "toolkit/components/tooltip";

// Import the CSS for all components
@import "toolkit";
```
