# Installing Grunt #

To run commands from the command line, Grunt and Node.js are required. Node.js can be downloaded and installed from their website: http://nodejs.org

After Node.js is installed, open the command line and `cd` into the Toolkit project. Once there, install the Node.js modules.

	npm install

Then install Grunt globally.

	npm install -g grunt-cli

Then verify that Grunt is working by running the grunt command. This should validate and build the Toolkit source files.

	grunt

That's it! Jump over to the other documentation to learn about custom builds.
