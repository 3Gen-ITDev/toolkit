Titon Toolkit is a collection of very powerful user interface components and utility classes.
Each component represents encapsulated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript functionality for role specific page elements.

Titon makes use of the latest and greatest technology. This includes CSS3 for animation (fade, slide, etc),
Sass for CSS pre-processing, and Grunt for task and package management.
