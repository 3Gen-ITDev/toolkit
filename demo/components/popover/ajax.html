<p>Titans were a primeval race of powerful deities, descendants of Gaia (Earth) and Uranus (Sky),
    that ruled during the legendary Golden Age. They were immortal giants of incredible strength and
    were also the first <span title="Greek Pantheon" data-popover="ajax/pantheon.html" data-popover-ajax="true" data-popover-position="bottom-center">pantheon</span>
    of Greek gods and goddesses.</p>

<p>In the first generation of twelve Titans, the males were
    <span data-popover="Titan of the Earth-river" data-popover-position="top-left">Oceanus</span>,
    <span data-popover="Titan of Light" data-popover-position="top-center">Hyperion</span>,
    <span data-popover="Titan of Intelligence" data-popover-position="top-right">Coeus</span>,
    <span data-popover="King of the Titans" data-popover-position="bottom-left">Cronus</span>,
    <span data-popover="Titan of the Heavens" data-popover-position="bottom-center">Crius</span>,
    and <span data-popover="Titan of Mortality" data-popover-position="bottom-right">Iapetus</span>
    and the females—the Titanesses or Titanides—were
    <span data-popover="Titaness of Memory" data-popover-position="top-left">Mnemosyne</span>,
    <span data-popover="Titaness of Water" data-popover-position="top-center">Tethys</span>,
    <span data-popover="Titaness of Sight" data-popover-position="top-right">Theia</span>,
    <span data-popover="Titaness of the Moon" data-popover-position="bottom-left">Phoebe</span>,
    <span data-popover="Titaness of Fertility" data-popover-position="bottom-center">Rhea</span>,
    and <span data-popover="Titaness of Justice" data-popover-position="bottom-right">Themis</span>.
    The second generation of Titans consisted of Hyperion's children Helios, Selene and Eos;
    Coeus's daughters Leto and Asteria; Iapetus's children Atlas, Prometheus, Epimetheus, and Menoetius;
    Oceanus' daughter Metis; and Crius' sons Astraeus, Pallas, and Perses.</p>

<p>The Titans were overthrown by a race of younger gods, the
    <span title="Olympians" data-popover="ajax/olympians.html" data-popover-ajax="true" data-popover-position="center-left">Olympians</span>,
    in the <span title="Titanomachy" data-popover="ajax/titanomachy.html" data-popover-ajax="true" data-popover-position="center-right">Titanomachy</span>.
    The Greeks may have borrowed this mytheme from the Ancient Near East.</p>
