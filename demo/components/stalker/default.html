        <h3 id="primordials">Primordials</h3>

        <p>In Greek mythology the primordial deities are the first entities or beings that come into existence.
            These deities are a group of gods from which all the other gods descend. They preceded the Titans,
            the descendants of Gaia and Uranus.</p>

        <p>The primordial gods are depicted as places or realms. A common example is Tartarus,
            who is depicted as the Underworld, Hell, and a bottomless abyss. His sibling, Erebus,
            is also depicted as a place of pitch-black darkness or a vast emptiness of space.
            Their mother, Chaos, is depicted as an empty void. Other siblings that include Gaia are depicted
            as Mother Nature or the Earth. Pontus or Hydros are depicted as the oceans, lakes, and rivers.
            Chronos is depicted as time and of eternity.</p>

        <h3 id="titans">Titans</h3>

        <p>Titans were a primeval race of powerful deities, descendants of Gaia (Earth) and Uranus (Sky),
            that ruled during the legendary Golden Age. They were immortal giants of incredible strength and
            were also the first pantheon of Greek gods and goddesses.</p>

        <p>In the first generation of twelve Titans, the males were Oceanus, Hyperion, Coeus, Cronus, Crius,
            and Iapetus and the females—the Titanesses or Titanides—were Mnemosyne, Tethys, Theia, Phoebe, Rhea,
            and Themis. The second generation of Titans consisted of Hyperion's children Helios, Selene and Eos;
            Coeus's daughters Leto and Asteria; Iapetus's children Atlas, Prometheus, Epimetheus, and Menoetius;
            Oceanus' daughter Metis; and Crius' sons Astraeus, Pallas, and Perses.</p>

        <p>The Titans were overthrown by a race of younger gods, the Olympians, in the Titanomachy ("War of the Titans").
            The Greeks may have borrowed this mytheme from the Ancient Near East.</p>

        <h3 id="olympians">Olympians</h3>

        <p>In the ancient Greek religion, the Twelve Olympians are the major deities of the Greek pantheon,
            commonly considered to be Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Ares, Aphrodite,
            Hephaestus, Hermes and either Hestia, or Dionysus. Hades and Persephone were sometimes included as
            part of the twelve Olympians (primarily due to the influence of the Eleusinian Mysteries),
            although in general Hades was excluded, because he resided permanently in the underworld and never
            visited Mount Olympus. Heracles and Asclepius were sometimes included as well.</p>

        <h3 id="muses">Muses</h3>

        <p>The Muses, in Greek mythology, poetry and literature, are the goddesses of the inspiration of literature,
            science and the arts. They were considered the source of the knowledge, related orally for centuries in
            the ancient culture, that was contained in poetic lyrics and myths.</p>

        <p>The Muses were both the embodiments and sponsors of performed metrical speech:
            mousike was just "one of the arts of the Muses". Others included Science, Geography, Mathematics,
            Philosophy, and especially Art, Drama, and inspiration. Some authors invoke Muses when writing poetry,
            hymns or epic history. The invocation typically occurs at or near the beginning, and calls for help or
            inspiration, or simply invites the Muse to sing through the author. </p>

        <h3 id="nymphs">Nymphs</h3>

        <p>A nymph in Greek mythology and in Latin mythology is a minor female nature deity typically associated
            with a particular location or landform. Different from goddesses, nymphs are generally regarded as
            divine spirits who animate nature, and are usually depicted as beautiful, young nubile maidens who
            love to dance and sing; their amorous freedom sets them apart from the restricted and chaste wives
            and daughters of the Greek polis. They are believed to dwell in mountains and groves, by springs
            and rivers, and also in trees and in valleys and cool grottoes. Although they would never die of
            old age nor illness, and could give birth to fully immortal children if mated to a god, they
            themselves were not necessarily immortal, and could be beholden to death in various forms.
            Charybdis and Scylla were once nymphs.</p>
