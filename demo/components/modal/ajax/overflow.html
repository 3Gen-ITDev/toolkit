    <h3>Titans</h3>

    <p>Titans were a primeval race of powerful deities, descendants of Gaia (Earth) and Uranus (Sky),
        that ruled during the legendary Golden Age. They were immortal giants of incredible strength and
        were also the first pantheon of Greek gods and goddesses.</p>

    <p>In the first generation of twelve Titans, the males were Oceanus, Hyperion, Coeus, Cronus, Crius,
        and Iapetus and the females—the Titanesses or Titanides—were Mnemosyne, Tethys, Theia, Phoebe, Rhea,
        and Themis. The second generation of Titans consisted of Hyperion's children Helios, Selene and Eos;
        Coeus's daughters Leto and Asteria; Iapetus's children Atlas, Prometheus, Epimetheus, and Menoetius;
        Oceanus' daughter Metis; and Crius' sons Astraeus, Pallas, and Perses.</p>

    <p>The Titans were overthrown by a race of younger gods, the Olympians, in the Titanomachy ("War of the Titans").
        The Greeks may have borrowed this mytheme from the Ancient Near East.</p>

    <h3>Olympians</h3>

    <p>In the ancient Greek religion, the Twelve Olympians are the major deities of the Greek pantheon,
        commonly considered to be Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Ares, Aphrodite,
        Hephaestus, Hermes and either Hestia, or Dionysus. Hades and Persephone were sometimes included as
        part of the twelve Olympians (primarily due to the influence of the Eleusinian Mysteries),
        although in general Hades was excluded, because he resided permanently in the underworld and never
        visited Mount Olympus. Heracles and Asclepius were sometimes included as well.</p>
